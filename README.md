# The Mojolicious Toolkit

Mojolicious is more than a real-time web framework. It's a comprehensive toolkit for building connected Perl applications of all kinds. We'll look at as much of the toolkit as we can, and leave the rest for you to explore on your own.

Some code samples are taken or adapted from the Mojolicious documentation, while others are little applications I've written to further highlight some aspect of a module I found interesting.

This code is part of a presentation ([slides](https://scottw.github.io/presentations/mojolicious-toolkit) and [2017 recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hdf7ZgKoBLo).
