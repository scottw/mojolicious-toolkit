# The Mojolicious Toolkit

[Mojolicious](https://mojolicious.org) is more than a real-time web framework. It's a comprehensive toolkit for building connected Perl applications of all kinds. We'll look at as much of the toolkit as we can, and leave [the rest](https://metacpan.org/release/Mojolicious) for you to explore on your own.

Some code samples are taken or adapted from the [Mojolicious documentation](https://mojolicious.org/perldoc), while others are little applications I've written to further highlight some aspect of a module I found interesting.

This code is part of a presentation ([slides](https://scottw.github.io/presentations/mojolicious-toolkit) and [2017 recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hdf7ZgKoBLo)).
